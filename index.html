            <p>In this proud land we grew up strong<br>
                We were wanted all along<br>
                I was taught to fight, taught to win<br>
                I never thought I could fail<br>
                No fight left or so it seems<br>
                I am a man whose dreams have all deserted<br>
                I've changed my face, I've changed my name<br>
                But no one wants you when you lose<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                'cause you have friends<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                You're not beaten yet<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                I know you can make it good<br>
                Though I saw it all around<br>
                Never thought I could be affected<br>
                Thought that we'd be the last to go<br>
                It is so strange the way things turn<br>
                Drove the night toward my home<br>
                The place that I was born, on the lakeside<br>
                As daylight broke, I saw the earth<br>
                The trees had burned down to the ground<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                You still have us<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                We don't need much of anything<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                'cause somewhere there's a place<br>
                Where we belong<br>
                Rest your head<br>
                You worry too much<br>
                It's going to be alright<br>
                When times get rough<br>
                You can fall back on us<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                Please don't give up<br>
                'got to walk out of here<br>
                I can't take anymore<br>
                Going to stand on that bridge<br>
                Keep my eyes down below<br>
                Whatever may come<br>
                And whatever may go<br>
                That river's flowing<br>
                That river's flowing<br>
                Moved on to another town<br>
                Tried hard to settle down<br>
                For every job, so many men<br>
                So many men no-one needs<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                'cause you have friends<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                You're not the only one<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                No reason to be ashamed<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                You still have us<br>
                Don't give up now<br>
                We're proud of who you are<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                You know it's never been easy<br>
                Don't give up<br>
                'cause I believe there's the a place<br>
                There's a place where we belong</p>
